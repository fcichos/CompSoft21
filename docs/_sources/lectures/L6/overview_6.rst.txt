Lecture Contents
================

In this 6th lecture we will have a look at

1. COVID19 models and data
2. Coupled Pendula
3. Fourier Analysis 

There will be no assignment for Lecture 5. I still have to prepare an assignment for Lecture 6. 
For those of you who are interested in the numbers of submitted exercises:

- exercise 1: 46
- exercise 2: 39
- exercise 3: 25
- exercise 4: 19

I think 50% submitted exercises qualify for the final project.
